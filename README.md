# multi-timer

Special thanks to ginop-1 for the inspiration on custom countdown & other fancy feature (timer search).
Checkout his react muti-timer here -> https://github.com/ginop-1/react-timer-app

For AsyncStorage I use Reactotron from "reactotron-react-native"

1. Quick install the desktop app with Reactotron.Setup.2.17.1.exe (or whatever is the latest version) on [release page](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases)
2. follow the [Quick Start for React Native](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/quick-start-react-native.md)
